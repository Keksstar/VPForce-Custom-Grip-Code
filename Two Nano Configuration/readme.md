# Two Nano Configuration
Uses two Arduino Nanos to achieve 32 buttons and 4 axes. Different code for each board, can be used with or without axes but not individually. If making a button only stick with this option, select "Generic Grip" in the VPF configurator. If axes are to be connected select "WinWing Adapter" in the VPF configurator.
